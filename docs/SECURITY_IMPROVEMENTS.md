# Security Improvements for TURTL

## Implemented Security Enhancements

### 1. Fault Attack Countermeasures

We've added a comprehensive set of fault attack detection mechanisms:

- **Re-encryption verification**: In the ML-KEM decapsulation process, we verify that the re-encrypted ciphertext matches the original ciphertext to detect any fault injections.
- **Shared secret integrity checking**: We've added verification of the integrity of shared secrets to detect any tampering during processing.
- **Bounds checking**: We've added boundary verification to ensure that values remain within expected ranges, which helps detect fault attacks that attempt to manipulate variables.
- **Constant-time comparisons**: All security-sensitive comparisons are now performed in constant time to prevent timing attacks and to ensure consistent behavior even under fault conditions.

### 2. Constant-Time Operations

We've implemented a robust constant-time operations toolkit:

- **Conditional moves**: Constant-time selection of values based on condition flags, without using branches.
- **Conditional swaps**: Swapping values without revealing the condition via timing.
- **Equality testing**: Comparison operations that don't leak information via timing side channels.
- **Slice operations**: Support for operating on entire byte slices in constant time.

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

We've improved the error handling system:

- **New error types**: Added specific error types for fault detection and security boundary violations.
- **Better error messages**: Enhanced error messages provide more context without leaking sensitive information.
- **Security-focused error handling**: Errors that might indicate security issues are handled specially.

### 4. Documentation

We've added comprehensive security documentation:

- **SECURITY.md**: A detailed security guide describing the protections in the library.
- **IMPLEMENTATION.md**: Documentation of implementation choices and security considerations.
- **Code comments**: Enhanced code comments explaining security considerations.

### 5. Testing

We've enhanced the testing framework with security-focused tests:

- **Error handling tests**: Tests that verify proper handling of invalid inputs and error conditions.
- **Constant-time operation tests**: Tests that verify the correctness of constant-time operations.
- **Fault detection tests**: Tests that verify the effectiveness of fault detection mechanisms.

## Future Security Enhancements

The following security enhancements should be considered for future versions:

1. **Side-channel resistant NTT**: Enhance the Number-Theoretic Transform implementation with additional side-channel protections.
2. **Hardware fault detection**: Add more sophisticated fault detection mechanisms that can detect hardware-level attacks.
3. **Memory hardening**: Implement additional protections for sensitive data in memory.
4. **SIMD optimizations**: Add vectorized implementations that maintain security properties.
5. **Formal verification**: Apply formal methods to verify security properties of critical parts of the code.

## Security Best Practices

When using TURTL, following these best practices is recommended:

1. **Update regularly**: Always use the latest version of TURTL with all security patches.
2. **Secure key storage**: Store private keys in secure, isolated storage.
3. **Memory protection**: Use platform-specific memory protection features when available.
4. **Input validation**: Always validate inputs before passing them to TURTL functions.
5. **Error handling**: Properly handle and log errors without exposing sensitive information.
6. **Rate limiting**: Implement rate limiting for cryptographic operations to mitigate certain attacks.
