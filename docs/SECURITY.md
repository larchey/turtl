# TURTL Security Documentation

This document outlines the security features and considerations for the TURTL (Trusted Uniform Rust Toolkit for Lattice-cryptography) library.

## Security Features

### Side-Channel Attack Resistance

TURTL implements various countermeasures against side-channel attacks:

1. **Constant-Time Operations**:
   - All comparison operations on sensitive data use constant-time functions
   - The `security::constant_time` module provides primitives for writing constant-time code
   - NTT operations are implemented to run in constant time

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Sensitive data (private keys, shared secrets) is automatically zeroized when dropped
   - The `zeroize` crate is used to ensure proper memory clearing

3. **Timing Attack Protections**:
   - Parameter validation is performed before cryptographic operations
   - Constant-time comparison for all secret-dependent branches
   - No early returns in critical cryptographic operations

### Fault Attack Resistance

TURTL implements countermeasures against fault injection attacks:

1. **Re-Encryption Verification**:
   - ML-KEM decapsulation re-encrypts the decrypted message to verify correctness
   - Failures are handled in constant time to prevent attacks

2. **Double-Checking Critical Operations**:
   - Integrity checks on sensitive data
   - Validation of computation results

3. **Boundary Checking**:
   - All array accesses are bounds-checked
   - Parameter validation ensures values are within expected ranges

## Implementation Security Considerations

### Randomness

- TURTL uses the OS random number generator (`OsRng`) for cryptographic operations
- Random sampling follows the specifications in NIST FIPS 203 and 204
- PRNGs are properly seeded with entropy from the OS

### Parameter Validation

- All public inputs are validated before use in cryptographic operations
- Parameter sets are checked for consistency
- Length validation on all inputs

### Error Handling

- Error types are designed to reveal minimal information about operations
- All errors are handled gracefully without leaking sensitive information
- No panic conditions in cryptographic code paths

## Security Boundaries

TURTL does not provide protection against:

1. Compromised execution environment (e.g., malware, hardware backdoors)
2. Side-channel attacks requiring physical access (e.g., power analysis, EM emissions)
3. Cryptanalytic advances against the underlying lattice problems
4. Key compromise through non-cryptographic means

## Security Recommendations

When using TURTL in your applications:

1. Keep your private keys secure and never expose them
2. Use the latest version of TURTL with all security updates
3. Consider key rotation and management policies
4. Implement additional application-level security measures
5. Update when new NIST guidance on ML-KEM or ML-DSA is released

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in TURTL:

1. Do not disclose it publicly on issue trackers
2. Follow responsible disclosure practices
3. Report the issue to the maintainers directly

## Compliance with NIST Standards

TURTL strives to comply fully with NIST FIPS 203 (ML-KEM) and NIST FIPS 204 (ML-DSA). Any deviations from the standards are documented and justified.
